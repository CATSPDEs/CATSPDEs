this project doesn’t contain any entry point program—only subroutines
and we use it to construct static .lib for usage in some other C++ projects
we use ifort compiler here mixed w/ Visual Studio*’s MSVC 
for installing instructions check out this repo: https://github.com/56th/CPP-Calls-FORTRAN-lib
iteroperability guide: https://software.intel.com/ru-ru/node/525330

our Harwell–Boeing subroutines are based on this sample: http://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket/src/hbcode2.f
and original book by Iain Duff, Roger Grimes, and John Lewis
